	* src/starengine/engine/camera.c (camera_update_frustum): Pratical
	results and theoricals results are not the same:bad equations for
	plane's normal.

2004-01-04  ben  <le.coyote@tiscali.fr>

	* src/starengine/engine/camera.c (camera_update_frustum): Left
	plane's normal seems to be OK...

2003-12-29  ben  <le.coyote@tiscali.fr>

	* src/starengine/engine/bbox.c: Added a 2d bbox, 2d frustum and 2d
	line.

2003-12-26  ben  <le.coyote@tiscali.fr>

	* src/starengine/engine/heightfieldinfo.c
	(heightfieldinfo_to_opengl): Tried to make it feels less like a
	hack.(still a mirroring problem)

	* src/starengine/math/matrix.c: Added an inverse function

2003-12-24  ben  <le.coyote@tiscali.fr>

	* src/starengine/engine/object2d.c: Added 2d objects managed into
	scene.c.

	* src/starengine/engine/heightfieldinfo.c
	(heightfieldinfo_to_opengl): Started a minimap.

2003-12-22  ben  <le.coyote@tiscali.fr>

	* src/game/starmain.c (handle_mouse): It's a handle so the mouse
	movement is independent of the FPS
	(init): The far/near distance caused div 0 in frustum when near was
	too small.

2003-12-21  ben  <le.coyote@tiscali.fr>

	* src/starengine/engine/heightfield.c (create_mesh_stripped_lod):
	This function create a mesh of the heightfield with the specified lod.

2003-12-20  ben  <le.coyote@tiscali.fr>

	* src/starengine/engine/heightfield.c (create_mesh_stripped):
	Added a stripped mesh version of the heightfield
	(create_mesh_stripped): Now the heightfield usse an array of double
	for z values.
